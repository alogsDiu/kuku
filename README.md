BEFORE ANYTHING PLEASE CHECK THE EXAMPLES OF .env AND .env.local 
.env IS FOR DOCKER
.env.local IS FOR NEXTJS

SO TO RUN THE PROJECT FIRST RUN:

npm run db:up 

AND THEN TO CREATE THE TABLES FROM A SCHEMA

npx prisma generate

AND THEN TO PUSH THE CHANGES TO THE DATABASE

npx prisma db push

AND IF YOU WANT TO ADD TEST USERS 

npm run db:init
